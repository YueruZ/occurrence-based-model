# occurrence-based-model
A summary of the code that has been used to generate the reuslt in manuscript "Predicting fundamental climate niches of forest trees based on species occurrence data" submitted by Yueru Zhao, Gregory A. Oâ€™Neill, and Tongli Wang. Details can be found in the file "code_summary_lodgepole pine.R". 
To avoid redundancy, this file only contacins code for lodgepole pine data even though both lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir's data were used for modelling in this research. Code for Douglas-fir is identical to the one used for lodgepole pine, with different dataset.
